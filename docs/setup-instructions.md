## Install the following in your local development environment -

0. Ruby (version 2.3.1) - I use a tool called RVM which is Ruby Version Manager for managing the ruby installations.  You can install RVM first and then use it to install a specific version of Ruby.
1. Ruby on Rails (version 4.1.5 is what we are currently locked in the `Gemfile`)
2. Nodejs (LTS)
3. MongoDb - [OSX Instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/?_ga=2.92839444.86106005.1504058999-1213989326.1504058999)
